    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "We studied [[Niculae et al., 2015]](#niculae) and it enabled us to highlight certain clues of language linked to the imminence of betrayal. We would like to apply similar techniques to detect betrayal in social deduction games, like [Town of Salem](#salem), [Secret Hitler](#hitler), [Among Us](#amongus) or [Werewolf/Mafia](#mafia). Is it possible, by studying the public exchanges of the players during a textual game, to spot the \"traitor\"? The major difference with the basic article is that we are not looking for a betrayal to come - the breaking of a friendship - but a betrayal that has already taken place - for instance, the \"wolf\" seeks to win by posing as a \"villager\". As such, we are going to analyse textual exchanges of different games, and try to apply the same methods to multiple sessions."

    "### Linguistic Harbingers of Betrayal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this code is to give an extension to the paper called [Linguistic Harbingers of Betrayal](http://vene.ro/betrayal/#paper). It was written by Vlad Niculae, Srijan Kumar, Jordan Boyd-Graber and Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper is a study of the interpersonal relations, and more precisely of the betrayal that can occur between two people. Its goal is to see if we can predict a forthcoming betrayal with linguistic signs in a dyadic interaction. In order to do that, the authors collected the conversations of people playing a strategic game called [*Diplomacy*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy) and they studied their interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their study concludes that slight changes in certain attributes of the conversation may indicate impending betrayal. These indicators are as follows: positive sentiment, politeness or focus on future planning-signal.\n",

    "### How to spot a traitor\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mafiascum Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to apply similar techniques to detect betrayal in a social deduction game called [*The Mafia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)). We found a [dataset](https://bitbucket.org/bopjesvla/thesis/src/master/) containing almost 1100 different games. They were taken on a website called [Mafiascum](https://www.mafiascum.net/) which allows player to discuss and play this game with the help of a moderator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between *Diplomacy* and and *The Mafia* is that in the second game, the traitors are present from the beginning of the game. Their goal is to avoid to be detected and eliminate all the other players. In *Diplomacy*, every player can become a traitor at some point of the game. We won't look for a betrayal to come - the breaking of a friendship - but a betrayal that has already taken place. As such, we are going to analyse textual exchanges in the game [*The Mafia*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK736KcqdK4)."
